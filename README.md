# BeatSphere_excercise
Decided to give Unity's Mesh creating a go, have to create some particle, and prototyping systems for a game I'm making, also because I have experience with 3D engines, and graphic languages and it's about time I use those skills in unity. This is a little exercise, it has a procedural sphere you can toy with in any way you want, and a BeatSphere as seen in this tweet https://twitter.com/Fern_hw/status/980236180766720001 I called like that because it plays to the beat of the music. This was fun to do, miss these little self-training sessions.

# About the music

This software comes with no music in it. you have to provide the music to make use of the beat sphere.
