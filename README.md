# BeatSphere_excercise
Decided to give Unity's Mesh creating a go since I have to create some particle, and prototyping systems for a game I'm making, also because I have experience with 3D engines and I should already now all the quirks of unity's mesh generator. So I gave myself this little exercise, it has a procedural sphere you can toy with in any way you want, and a BeatSphere as seen in this tweet https://twitter.com/Fern_hw/status/980236180766720001 I called like that because it plays to the beat of the music.
